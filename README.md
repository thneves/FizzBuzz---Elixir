# FizzBuzz

## Problem

Given a list of numbers:
- Multiples of 3 become "Fizz"
- Multiples of 5 become "Buzz"
- Multiples of 3 and 5 become "FizzBuzz"

Info:
- We gonna read the list from a file.
- In case the file doesn't exist we have to thrown an error message.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `fizz_buzz` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:fizz_buzz, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/fizz_buzz>.
